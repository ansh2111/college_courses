SQL INJECTION:
	SQL injection is a code injection technique that might destroy your database.
	SQL injection is one of the most common web hacking techniques.
	SQL injection is the placement of malicious code in SQL statements, via web page input.

FEW METHODS:
	SQL injection usually occurs when you ask a user for input, like their username/userid, and instead of a name/id, 
	the user gives you an SQL statement that you will unknowingly run on your database.

	Example:
	uid = getRequestString("userid");
	sql = "SELECT * FROM Users WHERE userid = " + uid;

	1.SQL Injection Based on 1=1 is Always True

	If there is nothing to prevent a user from entering "wrong" input, the user can enter some "smart" input like this:
	userid: 105 OR 1=1
	Then, the SQL statement will look like this: SELECT * FROM Users WHERE userid = 105 OR 1=1;
	The SQL above is valid and will return ALL rows from the "Users" table, since OR 1=1 is always TRUE. Similarly, Passwords can also be injected with 1=1.

	2.SQL Injection Based on ""="" is Always True

	Here is an example of a user login on a web site:
	Username:John Doe
	Password:abcd123

	Example
	uname = getRequestString("username");
	pass = getRequestString("password");
	sql = 'SELECT * FROM Users WHERE Username ="' + uname + '" AND password ="' + pass + '"'


	Result : SELECT * FROM Users WHERE Username ="John Doe" AND password ="abcd123"

	A hacker might get access to user names and passwords in a database by simply inserting " OR ""=" into the user name or password text box:
	The code at the server will create a valid SQL statement like this:
	Result: SELECT * FROM Users WHERE Username ="" or ""="" AND password ="" or ""=""
	The SQL above is valid and will return all rows from the "Users" table, since OR ""="" is always TRUE.

REFERENCES:	
	I have used an online site to perform sql injection "http://sqlzoo.net/hack/"
	In this we get access to username account by entering  'OR''='  as username and password. 
	And we get access to the account because this query always executes successfully.
